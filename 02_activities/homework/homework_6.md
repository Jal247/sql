**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.


Reflecting on my previous work as a business data analyst in a software company, my primary focus was on leveraging data to drive insights, optimise business processes, and support strategic decision-making. I worked extensively with customer business data, sales performance metrics, and operational analytics. The technical challenges were often centred on improving efficiency and profitability, but there was little formal consideration of how these data-driven decisions might impact ethical issues or contribute to inequity, both internally and externally. My role typically emphasised quantitative success—such as increased revenue or enhanced user engagement—without fully exploring the broader social implications of our analyses or how they might unintentionally cause biases or inequalities.
To adjust for these components, I would first integrate ethical frameworks into data collection and analysis processes. Data is often sourced from customers and users, ensuring privacy, consent, and we are not inadvertently exploiting sensitive personal information or contributing to discriminatory outcomes. By keeping these at the forefront of how data is gathered, stored, and utilised would be paramount. This means advocating for transparency in how user data is collected and ensuring that we adhere to regulations like GDPR and CCPA, not just for legal compliance but as a commitment to ethical data ministration. Additionally, I would incorporate bias detection into my models, actively identifying and mitigating any biases that could skew the results, especially when models influence decision-making processes like hiring, pricing, or product development. 
Furthermore, addressing inequity requires a deeper examination of how our software solutions and data-driven decisions impact different demographic groups particularly in countries like Canada. It’s not enough to report on averages or trends without considering whether certain groups (based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status) are systematically disadvantaged or overlooked. I would advocate for segmenting data to identify disparate impacts and recommend actions that promote equity. For example, if customer analytics show a bias in how certain services are used or accessed, I would push for product changes that make our software more inclusive and accessible to underrepresented groups.By bringing ethics and inequity into the conversation, we can create more inclusive products and services that aim for social good, not just profit.
Overall, the adjustment would involve embedding ethical considerations and social equity into every stage of the data lifecycle—from data collection to interpretation and decision-making. By balancing business objectives with an ethical framework, we can ensure that the power of data is used responsibly and equitably.
